MA in Philosophy (by Research)

Course Director: Professor Sir Roger Scruton, FBA, FRSL


Introduction

The purpose of this course is to present a vision of the places where philosophy impinges on life and casts light on it. The course offers students the intellectual equipment necessary to conduct hard and disciplined arguments about a soft and malleable material. Roger Scruton, the director of the course, is assisted by Samuel Hughes and Ralph Weir – both completing doctorates in philosophy at Cambridge, and by Dr Mikołaj Sławkowski-Rode, who is being lent to us by the University of Oxford. We shall be trying to teach philosophy both as it is as an academic discipline and as it might be applied to the pressing questions of our day, which include all of these: human nature – what kind of thing are we? Morality – how should we live? Sex – is this a biological, a moral or a spiritual category, and what in any case is the difference? Religion – does it have intellectual foundations, and is it a blessing, a curse or neither? Politics – how should we mediate the rival conceptions of justice, nationhood, civil society and public duty? Art – is there a real definition available, and if not how do you distinguishing real art from fake art? And so on.
The seminars take place in the Reform Club on Pall Mall, which, like all London clubs has a dress code: ties and jackets for men, and no jeans for women. We usually meet in the Barry Room. We start at 6.30 p.m. I (or, occasionally, a visiting speaker) introduce the topic with a lecture of about one hour and a quarter, which of course you are entitled to interrupt if you need clarification or if you disagree. We then adjourn for a drink while the staff prepare the table for dinner, over which we discuss the topic further. The cost of the dinner covers the cost of a certain amount of wine. But we can order more and usually do, philosophy being thirsty business.
A word on the university that permits this disgraceful experiment in civilised living. Buckingham is a unique institution, being organized in some respects on business principles, and paying people like us according to our success in attracting students. Its Chancellor, Lady Keswick, and Vice-Chancellor, Sir Anthony Seldon, have both distinguished themselves in other careers, the first in politics, the second as Headmaster of Wellington College. Founded by Margaret Thatcher, Buckingham was at first more a law and business school than a fully rounded university. Now it has a growing and successful humanities faculty, and takes advantage of the Charter which some neglectful bureaucrat allowed it to obtain in order to validate degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. It is expanding its presence in London, with the use of a building at 51 Gower Street and the possibility of obtaining a permanent home in the centre, within mortar range of the BBC. It is not surprising therefore that our course takes place in a private dining room at a London club, where we can enjoy discussion and wine over dinner, supplemented by private tutorials leading to a written thesis on a topic agreed between us. This return to civilised teaching, of people who are really interested in learning, has been a refreshing experience for us all, and the success of our first three years has encouraged us to offer the course for the foreseeable future.
	You will be assigned a ‘primary supervisor’, charged with directing your work through one-to-one tutorials, arranged at your mutual convenience. I will be your secondary supervisor, as well as the primary supervisor of some of you. All are entitled to badger me with enquiries and to ask that I read their work. Our hope is that you will all be satisfied with what teaching arrangements are agreed between us, and that you will encourage each other in learning and discussing the subject. 
	There are provisions for continuing to a Ph. D., but as yet we have not established the infrastructure and funding that would make this easy for us. During the course of the year we might be able to give some news on this. Meanwhile the important thing is to write your thesis and to discover the fundamental truth, which is that you don't know anything until you have tried to write it down.


Preliminary Reading

The preliminary reading will introduce some of those topics. I have tried to guide students through the history of modern philosophy in A Short History of Modern Philosophy Routledge, 2nd edn., 1995, and attempted an overview of the academic field as it was 20 years ago in Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey, now published by Penguin New York. 

Useful for the first term’s work will be the following: 
Nietzsche, The Genealogy of Morals.
Kant, The Foundations of the Metaphysic of Morals.
Plato, The Symposium.
Thomas Nagel, Mortal Questions. 

In order to get some sense of where philosophy now is, it would be good to look at these:
Simon Critchley, Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction
Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations.
Simon Blackburn, Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy.
Roger Scruton, Philosophy: Principles and Problems.


Seminars

The seminars run in tandem with the student’s own research, under supervision, on a topic of his or her choice, leading — by the end of the academic year — to the completion of the thesis, which should be submitted by the end of September 2019. From time to time, and at mutual convenience, we can arrange informal discussions around topics of particular interest or individual fields of research, to take place in the University’s London base, in 51 Gower Street, London WC1.
Before each seminar you will be sent one or two articles or extracts, which you should read in order to acquaint yourself with the topic to be discussed. The literature of philosophy is of course vast. But the purpose of the course is to give you the competences needed to read whatever you wish in this literature, as well as a sense of which parts are worth it.


Preliminary Meeting

Students are requested to make appointments with Izzy Brown, to meet me, Roger Scruton, and my three assistants, Ralph Weir, Samuel Hughes and Mikołaj Sławkowski-Rode, at some time between 4pm and 5.30 p.m. in 51 Gower Street, on Wednesday 26th September, in order to discuss a possible topic of research, to provide a general introduction to the talks, and to assign a tutor to each student. The formal seminars occur thereafter at the rate of approximately one a month, to take place in the Reform Club.

4. Thursday December 13th 2018.

Your opportunity to come to terms with the most important of all modern philosophers. I will set out to explain the technical terms and strategies of argument of the three Critiques, and hope to give you a useable map of the Critique of Pure Reason.
Reading: from Ralph Walker, Kant.



 Winter Term

6. Thursday January 10th 2019.
Guest Lecturer, Professor Sebastian Gardner: Introduction to the Philosophy of Hegel.

For a long time Hegel was either scorned or ignored by Anglophone philosophers, and there is no doubt that he is one of the most difficult of all writers in the subject, with large doses of charlatanry mixed into his imaginative and far-seeing arguments. Sebastian Gardner is Professor in the philosophy department at University College London, and is a renowned expert on continental philosophy, Kant, Sartre and Hegel. He will give you a map of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit, one of the most influential books to appear in the 19th century.
Reading will be sent out before the seminar.


7. Thursday 14th February 2019.
Roger Scruton: Wittgenstein, Husserl, Intentionality and other necessary matters.

The later philosophy of Wittgenstein, contained in the Philosophical Investigations and related writings, had a seismic effect on the discipline as it was taught in Anglophone universities, and people are still trying to come to terms with it. I shall focus on central strands in the argument, and on the connection to Husserl, Phenomenology, and the philosophy of language.
Reading: from Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations



Spring Term

8. Friday March 1st 2019.
Guest speaker, Professor Raymond Tallis: Darwinitis and neurononsense.

Ray Tallis is a retired neuro-surgeon, poet, novelist, essayist and uomo universale. He has led the charge against what he calls ‘neurononsense’, which is the habit of reducing all questions about the mind to questions about the nervous system, and has likewise lampooned the habit of answering philosophical questions with fragments of improvised evolutionary psychology. His talk will serve as an approach to the mind-body problem.  
Reading: John Hyman, ‘Art and Neuroscience’.
