\noindent I hereby declare that my thesis entitled {\bf Composition in change: A hylemorphic view} is the result of my own work and includes nothing which is the outcome of work done in collaboration and is not substantially the same as any that I have submitted, or, is concurrently submitted for a degree or diploma or other qualification at the University of Buckingham or any other University or similar institution. I further state that no substantial part of my thesis has already been submitted, or is concurrently submitted for any such degree, diploma, or other qualification at the University of Buckingham or any other University or similar institution.
